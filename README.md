# Chicory

Chicory is a supplemental software package management scheme
for Unix and Unix-like systems. It works alongside the primary
package manager of the system without interfering.

## Chicory

Chicory is the key ingredient in a special blend, traditionally of coffee. 

Chicory works well for just a single package, not necessarily a whole system.
Nothing technically prefents someone from using it for a whole system, but
Chicory works best when blended with other methods.

Chicory allows that packages can reside remotely or on removable media.
It does not require that software packages be shrink-wrapped for delivery.
It supports point-and-shoot.
