# Chicory

Chicory is a supplemental software package management scheme
for Unix and Unix-like systems. It works alongside the primary
package manager of the system without interfering.

## Chicory

Chicory is the key ingredient in a special blend, traditionally of coffee. 

Chicory works well for just a single package, not necessarily a whole
system. Nothing technically prevents someone from using it for a whole
system, but Chicory works best when blended with other methods.

Chicory allows that packages can reside remotely or on removable media.
It does not require that software packages be shrink-wrapped for delivery.
It supports point-and-shoot.

To date, more than 100 open source packages have been built with Chicory
and deployed on more than a dozen different systems (OS+HW combinations).
