# Dot-Slash-Configure

Chicory benefits from the so-called "standard recipe".


## Dot-Slash-Configure

The standard recipe is ...

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Not all Chicory packages follow the standard recipe,
but it makes integration easier.

## ./configure

It also helps if the `configure` script supports a prefix option.
