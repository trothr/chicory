# Source Code Signing Keys

Chicory build logic (in what we call a "wrapper" makefile)
can check the signature of a package source archive.
This directory is where some public keys for that purpose are found.

## Vet Your Keys

This collection is a small subset and is entirely PGP public keys.
(That is, while Chicory can use PKI certificates, no PKI certs are
found here at this time.)

Important note: <br/>
These keys (and more) have been used in Chicory development, but their
mere presence in this collection is not an endorsement. You'll have to
vet keys yourself.

Acquiring keys is well documented elsewhere.
For PGP keys, understanding the Web of Trust is essential.
And the vetting of keys is a manual process if you're going to use
the PGP model. The Chicory project does not propose to manage trust
for you. For true security, you'll want to know the trust paths firsthand.

*"It's all about trust!"*
